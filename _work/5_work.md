During my time at IIIT-Hyderabad, I served as a Teaching Assistant for the 'Digital Image Processing' course under the instruction of Prof. Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla. In this role, I was responsible for creating and evaluating assignments and quizzes for the students enrolled in the course. I had the opportunity to engage with students, provide guidance, and assist them in their understanding of the course material.
