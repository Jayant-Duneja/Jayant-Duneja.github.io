I worked on enhancing the bounding box generation pipeline of Meronym-Net, a controllable multi-category object generation model, through the application of advanced Computer Vision techniques. I conducted a series of experiments aimed at improving the model's performance. This involved modifying the existing model structure, introducing novel loss functions, and fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve higher accuracy levels.
