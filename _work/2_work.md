I was a part of the Customer Experience Team, which was dedicated to offering businesses a comprehensive solution for transaction-related communication across various channels. During my tenure, I undertook the development and testing of a Command Line Interface tool using Python. This tool was designed to streamline the process of examining error logs on the Splunk Dashboard by reducing lookup time and automating the task through API calls. The successful implementation of this tool resulted in improved efficiency and productivity. In recognition of my exceptional performance, I was awarded a PPO (Pre-Placement Offer) for my contributions to the team.
