I played a key role in developing an event-driven architecture for data pipelines using Java, SpringBoot, and Google PubSub. This architecture proved instrumental in automating approximately 75 workflows, enabling efficient and streamlined data processing. To ensure the reliability and robustness of the system, I incorporated unit tests and logic using technologies such as JUnit and SonarQube.

Furthermore, I took on the responsibility of designing and implementing pipelines within Azure Data Factory. These pipelines were specifically designed to facilitate the simulation of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, allowing for seamless data integration and transformation.
