Hello I am Jayant, a B. Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad. I am currently enrolled in the MS in Computer Science program as University of Colorado, Boulder and will be starting my school in Aug 2023. Previously, I have worked in Walmart Labs at Bangalore, India as a Software Engineer for 1 year. I am well acquainted with programming lanugages like C, Python and Java and have some experience with Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. 

Apart from work, I sports, football being my most favourite. When not working, I can be found either watching a football match or beating some one at a game of fifa!
