Hello, I am Jayant, pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Science program from the University of Colorado, Boulder. Previously, I completed my  B. Tech. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad following which I worked at Walmart Global Tech in Bangalore, India as a Software Engineer - 2 for one year. I am well acquainted with programming languages like C/C++, Python, and Java, and I have some experience in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

Apart from work, I enjoy sports, with football being my favorite. When I'm not working, you can find me either watching a football match or competing against someone in a game of FIFA.
